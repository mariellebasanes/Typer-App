## 🛠️ Files Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `INSTALL_AND_RUN.bat` | One-click installer and launcher |
| `setup.bat` | Install dependencies only |
| `run.bat` | Run the application |
| `multilanguage typer.py` | Main Python script |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies list |

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed" error
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, **check "Add Python to PATH"**
- Restart your computer after installation

### Dependencies won't install
- Check your internet connection
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Manually run: `python -m pip install pyperclip pyautogui`

### Code indentation is wrong
- Make sure you're using the LeetCode editor (not a plain text editor)
- Clear the editor completely before running the script
- Ensure your source code has proper indentation

## 📝 Tips

- **Test with simple code first** before trying complex solutions
- **Clear the LeetCode editor** before starting
- **Position your cursor** at the beginning of the editor
- **Don't touch your keyboard/mouse** while the script is running

## 🔒 Safety

- The script only types what's in your clipboard
- Press **Ctrl+C** anytime to stop the typing
- A 3-second countdown gives you time to switch windows

## 💡 Best Practices

1. Format your code properly before copying
2. Use consistent indentation (spaces recommended)
3. Test on a blank notepad first if unsure
4. Keep your system responsive - close unnecessary applications

## 📄 License

Free to use for personal and educational purposes.
